Exploring Reddit API (PRAW).

My motivation for this personal project is that I want to see what is the most used camera and/or film in the subreddit Analog.

Next step is to create an interface and host it somewhere so users can interact with it and analyze subreddits.

How to run:
-------------------
After downloading/forking the repo:
1. Change the values for client_id, client_secret, username and password to your own. Create a reddit account, then get the API ID and Secret.

2. sudo pip install plotly (upgrade if needed)

3. Change the values for PLOTLY_USERNAME and PLOTLY_KEY with your own from plotly's API

4. Run .\countAnalog.py or .\searchSubreddits.py
